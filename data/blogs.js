    subtitle: "How to properly plan lighting in the kitchen",
    excerpt:
      "Lighting is not only important for working in the kitchen. In the kitchen living space, it also creates atmosphere. This is especially true, of course, if the kitchen has an open design and creates an open transition into the living and dining area. Well-planned mood or task lighting is therefore essential. You have many different options for integrating lighting into your kitchen: from simple workspace lighting underneath wall cabinets to significantly more sophisticated solutions such as integrated lighting for display cabinets, through to lighting for drawers and pull-outs inside cabinets. In handleless kitchens, it's even possible to equip all handle recesses with lighting.",

            <p>
              You should already consider light at the beginning of the planning
              process. Start by assessing natural light sources—not only for
              cabinet placement, but planning experts also consider the
              brightness by looking at the position of the windows in the room.
              The influx of daylight significantly contributes to the overall
              character and determines where and to what extent you should plan
              additional lighting. Here are our highlight tips and tricks
              regarding light and illumination in the kitchen:

              opening the doors, the entire width of the cabinet's contents is
              directly visible and easily accessible. Planned as tall cabinets,
              hinged door cabinets provide ample storage space. Here, kitchen
              appliances, household aids and dishes, for example, can find their

                solutions for efficiently utilizing corner areas in kitchens.
                Both systems optimize storage space in corners that would
                otherwise be difficult to access, but each offers different
                mechanisms and advantages. Here is a detailed comparison of
                these two corner solutions: The carousel consists of circular
                shelves that rotate around a central axis. These cabinets are
                often equipped with a door that opens outward. By rotating the
                carousel, you can access the various segments hidden behind the
                corner. Contents are easily accessible by simply rotating the
                shelves. A carousel makes highly efficient use of the available
                corner space, fully utilizing it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-justify">
                Named after the famous curve on the racetrack, the "Le Mans"
                corner cabinet consists of shelves that pull out and swivel
                sideways. These cabinets are often equipped with two independent
                moving parts. The shelves are designed to be fully pulled out of
                the cabinet, allowing easy access to every area.

              A pull-out pantry unit is typically slim and tall, featuring a
              large, pull-out front. The design is very modern and can be
              integrated in different finishes. The pantry unit guarantees
              excellent visibility and accessibility from two sides, since the
              entire interior of the cabinet can be pulled out. This makes
              provisions easy and quick to reach, even in areas further back.

      "A well-planned utility room makes everyday life much easier. At Nolte Küchen, we think beyond the classic kitchen and offer intelligent solutions to make optimal use of even small spaces.

          Washing, ironing, storing groceries, changing clothes after work,
          collecting returnable bottles and waste glass, or whatever else needs
          to be done: The utility room was once a commonplace room in every
          household. Mainly for reasons of space, it had fallen out of fashion.
          And now, for reasons of space, it is back again! Its clear and
          logically arranged structure makes the household more compact and
          efficient. From washing machines, dryers and ironing board to grocery
          supplies, cleaning agents and utensils, wardrobe storage and recycling
          systems: A utility room not only complements modern, design-oriented
          kitchens. It also frees up other areas, creating space for relaxed
          living enjoyment.

    excerpt:
      "The 1920s are providing inspiration for the 2020s. We call this development of the Art Deco style “New Classic”. The typical features of Art Deco are a clear geometric style idiom, which reached its peak in the 1920s. Artists and aesthetic icons like Matisse, Picasso or George Braque are rightly still celebrated today. The elegant interplay of clean shapes, colours and surfaces is the distinguishing feature of this style. The result is a unique, independent design that stands out from the crowd and is truly memorable. The world of “New Classic” offers function and lifestyle comfort for your kitchen, paired with a touch of nostalgia.",

              <li>
                Bronze-tinted glass, harmonising perfectly with the frame,

            <p className="text-justify">
              The TORINO LACK features an impressively subtle style with clean
              shapes. Its soft mat lacquer surface and the striking graphic
              design with an offset frame make it a real eye-catcher. As part of
              the Nolte Küchen mat lacquer concept, it is available in 19
              colours.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">The Bronze Age of Today</h2>
            <p className="text-justify">
              With surfaces in manganese bronze, you pick up the metallic theme
              again. This way, you integrate glass doors, handles and fittings.
              Glass shelves and interior lighting create a strikingly modern
              impression.

            <p className="text-justify">
              Fit perfectly into the overall look: base units with drawers in
              scoop-optics and circular recessed handles.

            <p className="text-justify">
              Another distinctive feature are solid wood drawers. Handleless and
              reduced to the essentials, they create accents between the
              lacquered fronts, emphasizing the horizontal lines—not only on the
              kitchen island.

            <p className="text-justify">
              The New Classic thrives on harmonious contrasts. Wood also plays
              an important role. The two colors Oak Pinot and Oak Barolo can
              also be used for wall-mounted shelves or cross inserts (wall
              cabinet).
